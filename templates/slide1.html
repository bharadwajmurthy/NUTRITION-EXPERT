<h3>1. Hydrating The Body With Plain Water</h3>
<p>
Taylor Swift believes that to maintain a fit and well-toned body, you should keep it hydrated. For this, drinking plenty of fluids is an absolute necessity. She drinks about 10 bottles of water per day, which makes some of her friends crack jokes. However, the lady knows the benefits of keeping her body hydrated. She is so particular about drinking water that she carries a case in her vehicle as well.

Everyone feels like indulging in his/her favorite dishes occasionally, even if those are loaded with calories. And Taylor Swift is no exception. During weekends, she indulges in calorie-heavy comfort foods without hesitation. She prefers munching on a tiny burger and fries. A scoop of ice cream is yet another of her favorites. She also loves gorging on cookies and toffees made by her mother despite knowing they are high in calories.
